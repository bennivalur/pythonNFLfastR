# Python and NFLFastR
Some python files and function to help explore the NFLFastR

## Getting started
I would recommend taking a look at [Deryck97's nflfastR python guide][pythonguide]

And the twitter account of [nflfastR][twNFLFastR]

## Files and functions

### getData.py
Contains one function that can be imported into any other python file
like this

```python
from getData import getD
```
That function helps create the csv data files with the data needed withouth all the extra stuff

### hotcold.py
Looks at EPA in different temperature condition and creates a graph
